Romain is an artist best known for his ability to interrogate and push art mediums to their limits. He has a background in computer science and his work spans a diverse range of practice such as photography, film, digital and computational creations.

With *loss="binary_crossentropy"* (2019), he brought the latent space of machine learning into the gallery space to explore the operational contexts in medical imaging.

He is now involved in a long term collaboration with a group of dancers from Trinity Laban and his latest series of works focus on revisiting the use of the slit-scan photography technique.
